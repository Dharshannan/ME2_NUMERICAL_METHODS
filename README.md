# ME2_NUMERICAL_METHODS
This Rep is for the various Numerical Methods that we have learned in our ME2 Maths module, I will be uploading my pyhton code for most if not all the numerical methods we will be covering in the module. Feel free to use these codes within any of the computing tutorials. 
Yours truly,
Dharshannan-Just your average Mech Eng dude.
